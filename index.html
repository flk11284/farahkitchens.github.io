		<h2> Why should you not use plastic straws?

		</h2> 
	
		
		<p> Plastic straws are amongst one of the most unnecessary causes for polluting the Earth. 
		We have become so accustom to them when in reality we can easily do without them. Think about 
		many times you use a straw and think about where you throw that straw away. It is virtually impossible
		to count how many straws have used in even one month. Straws are not biodegradable and they're difficult to 
		recylce.

		<h1> Why is this important? </h1>

		BODY {background-color:lightblue}
		</style>
		It is important to know what to recycle and what to not recyle. You do not want to put 
		something in the recyling bin that is not made to be recyled because it ultimatly slows down the 
		whole recyling process.  On the other hand not recyling something because you did not think it was
		a recylable item is bad for the entire environment. For example, if you did not think about recyling
		a straw that you just used, it could end up really hurting an animal (like the video linked above) or 
		it can contaminate the ground water. Recyling should not just be for the environmentally friendly people,
		it should be taken serious by everyone becuase it affects everyone, including you.

	<h2> Because It Affects You Too.. </h2>
	</div>

	<p> Contaminating the Earth does not just affect the planet and the wild life... it affects everything, imcluding YOU. How
	does it affect you? Well, think about this: when plastic is not recyled it either washes into a river and ends up in a lake/ocean
	or its chemicals seep into the ground water system. Once it is in the ground water, that affects the water you drink, the vegatables
	and fruits you eat. Now that you see how it affects you, think about the impact it has on the wild life. They are living in contaminated water,
	drinking/eating unfiltered contaminated water and food. Now connect this... you eat those animals. Everything circles back around on this Planet.
	So next time you think recyling will not affect you, think again.
